          <p>I currently reside in Seattle, close to the University of Washington.
            I have lived in the city for all 24 years of my life and hope to continue
            doing so for some time to come.</p>

          <p>Following 4 years of studying Biology at the University of Washington,
            I decided I wanted to do some traveling to both see the world and give
            myself some time do figure out my next career move. I went to Mexico,
            Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador
            and finally Columbia. It took a 11 months in total and was easily one of
            the coolest experience I've had so far in life.</p>

            <li>Seeing Machu Picchu twice over a 6 month time frame, one time by train
                  and the other walking</li>
            <li>Snorkling with sharks, sting rays, loggerhead turtles, eagle rays and more

          <p>During my travels I realized that one day I would like to be a user
              experience designer or a product designer/industrial designer. My hope
              for the future is that I can find a way to incorporate the knowledge
              I have from my biology degree into products usable in the medical/research
              fields. I think there is a lot of opportunity in that area.</p>
