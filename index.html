    <h4>My Home</h4>
      <p>I currently reside in Seattle, close to the University of Washington.
        I have lived in the city for all 24 years of my life and hope to continue
        doing so for some time to come.</p>

      <h4>Travel</h4>
      <p>Following 4 years of studying Biology at the University of Washington,
      I decided I wanted to do some travelling to both see the world and give
      myself some time do figure out my next career move. I went to Mexico,
      Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador
      and finally Columbia. It took a 11 months in total and was easily the
      coolest experience I've had so far in life.</p>
      <aside>During this time I decided I wanted to go into User Experience
        and Product Design.</aside>

      <h4>Career Goals</h4>
      <p>One day I would like to be a user experience designer or a product
        designer/industrial designer. My hope for the future is that I can find
        a way to incorporate the knowledge I have from my biology degree into
        products usable in the medical/research fields. I think there is a lot
        of opportunity in that area.</p>
